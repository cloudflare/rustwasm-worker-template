# 👷‍♀️🦀🕸️ `rustwasm-worker-template`

A template for kick starting a Cloudflare worker project using
[`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack).

This template is designed for compiling Rust libraries into WebAssembly and
publishing the resulting worker to Cloudflare's worker infrastructure.

## 🔋 Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook)
  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
* [`wee_alloc`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc), an allocator optimized
  for small code size.
